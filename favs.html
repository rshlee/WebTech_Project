          As biased as this choice may be, Sonny has got to be my favorite
          player on the Spurs. A left-winger from South Korea, Son has been an
          integral part of the team since his arrival. He's netted some of the
          most crucial goals in the recent seasons, and even won the Goal of the
          Season in the 2019/20 campaign. He is now a globally recognized star
          and one of the best in his position in the world. As a fellow South
          Korean, I am very proud that he is able to put our small country on
          the map in a European-dominated sport.

          Harry Kane is a straight fan favorite. He is the captain of not only
          this Tottenham side, but even for his nation, England. Kane is one of
          the deadliest strikers in the world, and is on his way to break the
          EPL all-time goal scoring record that is currently held by Alan
          Shearer. When I see Kane's name on the team sheet, I know it's going
          to be a tough day for the opponents and I love watching his tenacity
          and leadership on the pitch. He is always ready to score or provide
          for his teammates and is simply a joy to watch.

          Toby Alderweireld, a center back from Belgium, is one of the longest
          serving members of this Tottenham squad. Although a defender by
          position, he boasts excellent technique on the ball and an expansive
          passing range that could unlock opposition defences in one pass. Not
          to mention, Toby is always willing to put his body on the line to make
          that goal-saving tackle week-in week-out and it is admirable to see
          his passion for the team.

          Pierre-Emile Højbjerg is a new signing this season. Initially, the
          Danish midfielder wasn't met with great response from the fan-base,
          but throughout this season he is proving every doubter wrong. If
          anything, he could be the signing of the season throughout the whole
          league. As a defensive midfielder, he puts in hard work to cover the
          backline while also providing a beautiful passing game to support the
          offense. In fact, he currently leads the team in tackles made and
          passes made, showing his tremendous contribution to our success.
